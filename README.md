### **2. Recommended KPI Targets & Gap Analysis**

The following targets are adopted from the industry framework and tailored for Jamjoom's context. The "Good" tier is set as the primary operational target.

#### **2.1. Critical Priority: Operational Stability & Loss Prevention**

| Metric | Current Baseline | Recommended Target ("Good") | Gap & Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Order Fulfillment Rate** | 36.79% | **95% - 98%** | **CRITICAL** (58-point gap) |
| **Total Losses** | 258.23 M | **Reduce by 30% in 12 months** | **CRITICAL** |
| **Number of Expired Products** | 2,451 | **Reduce by 50% in 6 months** | **CRITICAL** |

**Rationale:** Fixing fulfillment and reducing losses is not an optimizationâ€”it is a survival imperative. This directly recovers lost revenue and protects profit.

#### **2.2. Growth & Commercial Excellence**

| Metric | Current Baseline | Recommended Target ("Good") | Gap & Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Average Order Value (AOV)** | 2.06 M | **+5% to +10% YoY Growth** | **HIGH** (Establish baseline trend) |
| **Market Share** | 22% (Avg) | **+0.5 to +1.0 point gain YoY** | **HIGH** (Defend and grow leadership) |
| **Campaign Conversion Rate** | 4.65% | **Improve by 15-20% per cycle** | **MEDIUM** (Build on existing strength) |
| **Approval Cycle Time** | 15 days | **Reduce by 20% YoY (to ~12 days)** | **MEDIUM** (Improve agility) |

**Rationale:** The commercial engine is strong. Targets should focus on sustaining growth with greater efficiency.

    *   **Action:** Execute a 30-day audit to identify and manage near-expiry stock.
    *   **Goal:** Temporarily pause promotions on high-risk SKUs to prevent further losses.
*   **Initiative 3: Campaign Approval Triage**
    *   **Action:** Create an 'expedited' approval path for high-ROI campaign templates.
    *   **Goal:** Reduce time-to-market for proven campaign types.

*   **Initiative 6: Digital Approval Workflows**
    *   **Action:** Automate approval steps for standard requests with pre-defined thresholds.

### **4. Financial Impact & Governance**

*   **Direct P&L Impact:** A 30% reduction in Total Losses (258.23M) would save approximately **77.47 M SAR**, flowing directly to the bottom line.
*   **Revenue Recovery:** Improving the Order Fulfillment Rate from 37% to 80% would capture a significant portion of currently lost sales, potentially adding billions in revenue.
*   **Governance:**
    *   **KPI Owners:** Assign clear ownership (e.g., COO for Fulfillment/Losses, CMO for Conversion Rate).
    *   **Cadence:** Weekly operational reviews for critical metrics (Fulfillment, Losses); monthly executive steering for growth metrics.
    *   **Escalation Triggers:** If fulfillment drops below 80% for two consecutive weeks, escalate to the Supply Chain Director and CEO.

### **5. Next Steps**

1.  **Formally Approve** these KPI targets as the Q4 operational goals.
2.  **Launch the "Fulfillment Stabilization" sprint** within the next 7 days with a defined charter and team.
3.  **Commission a detailed financial model** to quantify the exact revenue upside from improving fulfillment rates.
4.  **Initiate the 30-day expiry audit** across all warehouses and key distributors.
